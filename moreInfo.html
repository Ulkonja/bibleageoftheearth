 <p>
   The Sacred Calendar is the calendar of the Old Testament, consisting with 364-days. As this calendar has full 52 weeks, the beginning of the year, Tishri 1-st, is always a "FRIDAY". The last day of the Calendar is Thursday, Elul 29-th. Between the first month of Tishri and the second month of Heshvan, 8 additional days are inserted named as "Creation Week - Tishri31".

    <p>
    The names for the months in the Sacred Calendar are kept the same as the months in the currently used Hebrew Calendar. Some of the months are with 30 days and some other months with 29 days, as presented below. The Sacred Calendar of Genesis starts on Tishri 1-st, while the The Sacred Calendar of Exodus starts on Nisan 1-st according to Ex. 12:2 & Esther 3:7.

    <p>
   The 364-Day calendar is neither lunar nor solar. On the 364-Day calendar, Tishri 1 is always a Friday, according to the dictates of Leviticus 23:32. This section of Leviticus has Tishri 9 always falling on a Sabbath Saturday and Tishri 10, the Day of Atonement, is always a Sunday. Tishri 1 never falls on a Wednesday or Friday on the currently used Hebrew secular calendar and is thus disqualified as a contender for being the Hebrew calendar consistent with the Old Testament.
   <p>
   The dates and days of the week of the Sacred Calendar are the same day of the week every year. This is the most likely explanation for the fact that the Sunday through Saturday days of the week are never mentioned anywhere in Scripture. 364 days/year are exactly 52 full weeks per year (52*7=364 days/year).
   <p>
   When the numerical day of the month and the number or name of the month is given, it is assumed that the reader knows what day of the week it is simply by having this basic information. For example, the reader of Lev.23:32 would know that Tishri 9 is always a Sabbath when Tishri is the seventh month after the Exodus. Using this same logic, the Day of Atonement that always falls on Tishri 10, would always be a Sunday.
   <p>
   It is of outmost importance which are the months with 29 days. Note that the months with 29 days in the Sacred Calendar are the months which in the currently used Hebrew Calendar have always 29 days: Tevet, Iyyar, Tammuz, Elul.  There are two biblical possibilities of controlling if a calendar is consistent with the Old Testament, described in the following paragraphs. 
   <p>
   According to the Flood event presented in Genesis 7 & 8, there are 150 days of rain, starting from the 17.02.600th year of Noah to the 17.07.600th year of Noah [Gen. 7:11, 7:24, 8:4]. In order to have 150 days there must be only one month with 29 days in-between. If all the months are with 30 days, there are 151 days between these two dates (the calendar with 360 days is not consistent with the Biblical Events). In the Sacred Calendar of Genesis, being in use during the Flood Event, between the second month of Heshvan and the Seventh month of Nisan there is only one month with 29 days, Tevet, resulting to 150 days. 
   <p>
   The other controlling event is the counting of 50 days between the Feast of the First Born and Feast of Pentecost [Deut 16:9-10], in the Sacred Calendar of Exodus. There are 50 days between Nisan 16th (Feast of the First Born) and Sivan 6th, Feast of Pentecost, which is only possible because the month of Iyyar has 29 days.

    <p>
    The Gregorian calendar is a modified version of the Julian calendar.
    The only difference being the specification of leap years.  The
    Julian calendar specifies that every year that is a multiple of 4
    will be a leap year.  This leads to a year that is 365.25 days long,
    but the current accepted value for the tropical year is 365.242199
    days.

    <p>
    To correct this error in the length of the year and to bring the
    vernal equinox back to March 21, Pope Gregory XIII issued a papal
    bull declaring that Thursday October 4, 1582 would be followed by
    Friday October 15, 1582 and that centennial years would only be a
    leap year if they were a multiple of 400.  This shortened the year
    by 3 days per 400 years, giving a year of 365.2425 days.

    <p>
    Another recently proposed change in the leap year rule is to make
    years that are multiples of 4000 not a leap year, but this has never
    been officially accepted and this rule is not implemented in these
    algorithms.

    <p><b>Valid Range:</b> 4714 B.C. to 9999 A.D.

    <p>
    Although this software can handle dates all the way back to 4714
    B.C., such use may not be meaningful.  The Gregorian calendar was
    not instituted until October 15, 1582 (or October 5, 1582 in the
    Julian calendar).  Some countries did not accept it until much
    later.  For example, Britain converted in 1752, Russia in 1918 and
    Greece in 1923.  Most European countries used the Julian calendar
    prior to the Gregorian.

<p>&nbsp;<p>
<font size="+2"><a name=Julian id="jul" name="jul"> <b>Julian calendar</b></a></font> <i> [Source:<a href = "https://www.rosettacalendar.com/"> Rosetta Calendar]</a></i>

    <p>
    Julias Ceasar created the calendar in 46 B.C. as a modified form of
    the old Roman republican calendar which was based on lunar cycles.
    The new Julian calendar set fixed lengths for the months, abandoning
    the lunar cycle.  It also specified that there would be exactly 12
    months per year and 365.25 days per year with every 4th year being a
    leap year.

    <p>
    Note that the current accepted value for the tropical year is
    365.242199 days, not 365.25.  This lead to an 11 day shift in the
    calendar with respect to the seasons by the 16th century when the
    Gregorian calendar was created to replace the Julian calendar.

    <p>
    The difference between the Julian and today's Gregorian calendar is
    that the Gregorian does not make centennial years leap years unless
    they are a multiple of 400, which leads to a year of 365.2425 days.
    In other words, in the Gregorian calendar, 1700, 1800 and 1900 are
    not leap years, but 2000 is.  All centennial years are leap years in
    the Julian calendar.

    <p>
    The details are unknown, but the lengths of the months were adjusted
    until they finally stablized in 8 A.D. with their current lengths:

    <pre>
        January          31
        February         28/29
        March            31
        April            30
        May              31
        June             30
        Quintilis/July   31
        Sextilis/August  31
        September        30
        October          31
        November         30
        December         31
    </pre>

    <p>
    In the early days of the calendar, the days of the month were not
    numbered as we do today.  The numbers ran backwards (decreasing) and
    were counted from the Ides (15th of the month - which in the old
    Roman republican lunar calendar would have been the full moon) or
    from the Nonae (9th day before the Ides) or from the beginning of
    the next month.

    <p>
    In the early years, the beginning of the year varied, sometimes
    based on the ascension of rulers.  It was not always the first of
    January.

    <p>
    Also, today's epoch, 1 A.D. or the birth of Jesus Christ, did not
    come into use until several centuries later when Christianity became
    a dominant religion.

    <p><b>Valid Range</b>: 4713 B.C. to 9999 A.D.

    <p>
    Although this software can handle dates all the way back to 4713
    B.C., such use may not be meaningful.  The calendar was created in
    46 B.C., but the details did not stabilize until at least 8 A.D.,
    and perhaps as late at the 4th century.  Also, the beginning of a
    year varied from one culture to another - not all accepted January
    as the first month.

<p>&nbsp;<p>
<font size="+2"><a name=Hebrew id="heb" name="heb"> <b>Hebrew calendar</b> </a></font><i>[Source:<a href = "https://www.rosettacalendar.com/"> Rosetta Calendar]</a></i>

    <p>
    The Hebrew calendar is based on lunar as well as solar cycles.  A
    month always starts on or near a new moon and has either 29 or 30
    days (a lunar cycle is about 29 1/2 days).  Twelve of these
    alternating 29-30 day months gives a year of 354 days, which is
    about 11 1/4 days short of a solar year.

    <p>
    Since a month is defined to be a lunar cycle (new moon to new moon),
    this 11 1/4 day difference cannot be overcome by adding days to a
    month as with the Gregorian calendar, so an entire month is
    periodically added to the year, making some years 13 months long.

    <p>
    For astronomical as well as ceremonial reasons, the start of a new
    year may be delayed until a day or two after the new moon causing
    years to vary in length.  Leap years can be from 383 to 385 days and
    common years can be from 353 to 355 days.  These are the months of
    the year and their possible lengths:

    </pre>

    <p>
    Note that the month names and other words that appear in this file
    have multiple possible spellings in the Roman character set.  I have
    chosen to use the spellings found in the Encyclopedia Judaica.

    <p>
    Adar II, the month added for leap years, is sometimes referred to as
    the 13th month, but I have chosen to assign it the number 7 to keep
    the months in chronological order.  This may not be consistent with
    other numbering schemes.

    <p>
    Leap years occur in a fixed pattern of 19 years called the metonic
    cycle.  The 3rd, 6th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th and 19th years of this
    cycle are leap years.  The first metonic cycle starts with Hebrew
    year 1, or 3761/60 B.C.  This is believed to be the year of
    creation.

    <p>
    To construct the calendar for a year, you must first find the length
    of the year by determining the first day of the year (Tishri 1, or
    Rosh Ha-Shanah) and the first day of the following year.  This
    selects one of the six possible month length configurations listed
    above.

    <p>
    Finding the first day of the year is the most difficult part.  Finding
    the date and time of the new moon (or molad) is the first step.  For
    this purpose, the lunar cycle is assumed to be 29 days 12 hours and 793
    halakim.  A heleq (singular form of halakim) is 1/1080th of an hour or
    3 1/3 seconds.  (This assumed value is only about 1/2 second less than
    the value used by modern astronomers -- not bad for a number that was
    determined so long ago.)  The first molad of year 1 occurred on Sunday
    at 11:11:20 P.M.  This would actually be Monday, because the Hebrew day
    is considered to begin at sunset.

    <p>
    Since sunset varies, the day is assumed to begin at 6:00 P.M.  for
    calendar calculation purposes.  So, the first molad was 5 hours 204
    halakim after the start of Tishri 1, 0001 (which was Monday
    September 7, 3761 B.C. by the Gregorian calendar).  All subsequent
    molads can be calculated from this starting point by adding the
    length of a lunar cycle.

    <p>
    Once the molad that starts a year is determined the actual start of
    the year (Tishri 1) can be determined.  Tishri 1 will be the day of
    the molad unless it is delayed by one of the following four rules
    (called dehiyyot).  Each rule can delay the start of the year by one
    day, and since rule #1 can combine with one of the other rules, it
    can be delayed as much as two days.

    <ol>

       <li> Tishri 1 must never be Sunday, Wednesday or Friday.  (This
            is largely to prevent certain holidays from occurring on the
            day before or after the Sabbath.)

       <li> If the molad occurs on or after noon, Tishri 1 must be
            delayed.

       <li> If it is a common (not leap) year and the molad occurs on
            Tuesday at or after 3:11:20 A.M., Tishri 1 must be delayed.

       <li> If it is the year following a leap year and the molad occurs
            on Monday at or after 9:32:43 and 1/3 sec, Tishri 1 must be
            delayed.

    1 (3761 B.C.), such use may not be meaningful.

    <p>
    The Hebrew calendar has been in use for several thousand years, but
    in the early days there was no formula to determine the start of a
    month.  A new month was started when the new moon was first
    observed.

    <p>
    It is not clear when the current rule based calendar replaced the
    observation based calendar.  According to the book "Jewish Calendar
    Mystery Dispelled" by George Zinberg, the patriarch Hillel II
    published these rules in 358 A.D.  But, according to The
    Encyclopedia Judaica, Hillel II may have only published the 19 year
    rule for determining the occurrence of leap years.

    <p>
    I have yet to find a specific date when the current set of rules
    were known to be in use.
